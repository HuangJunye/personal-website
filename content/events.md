- **[NUS QEP Qiskit Workshop](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/huangjunye_ibm-ibmquantum-qiskit-activity-6668809943338110976-wIyS)** (May 18-20) - Together with National University of Singapore Quantum Engineering Programme, IBM Singapore hosted a very successful 3-day online hands-on quantum workshop with Qiskit. Over 100 participants attended the workshop, from local universities, research institutes and private industries with diverse expertises. Workshop schedule of materials can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/HuangJunye/NUS-Qiskit-Workshop).

- **Singapore American School Science Club Outreach** (May 15) - After my SGInnovate talk on April 28, a high school student Harsha Polavaram reached out to me for an online outreach with the members of Science Club of Singapore American School where he is the president. We had a 2-hour online interaction where I showed quantum circuits escape rooms in Qiskit Blocks and Q&A with the students. I was genuinely surprised by the level of understanding and the questions raised by these high school students.

- **[Going Quantum with Qiskit](https://www.meetup.com/IBM-Developer-Sydney/events/270495928/) @ Sydney & Melbourne** (May 13) - Qiskit intro demo, similar to the one presented in Fast Start AP eConference in April.

Just kidding :) Please let me know what you think about the episode. I have no idea if it was a disaster because I can't stand listenning to myself talking.

([slides](https://github.com/HuangJunye/presentations/blob/master/2020-04-28%20IBM%20Garage%20Fast%20Start/IBM%20Garage%20Fast%20Start%20Qiskit%20Demo.ipynb), [video](https://secure.video.ibm.com/channel/23620033/video/126610770))

- **[IBM Quantum Pitch Contest](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/technology/how-tech-can-help-tackle-covid-19)** (Apr 24) - A pitch contest for near term applications development using quantum systems that are available on IBM Quantum Experience. Three winning teams were chosen by the judging panel: Mr. George Loh, Director of NRF, Dr. Joe Fitzsimon, CEO of Horizon Quantum Computing, Dr. Ewan Munro, CTO of Entropica Labs and myself. The results were announced on [Business Times](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/technology/how-tech-can-help-tackle-covid-19), inside "Quantum key to future" box at the end of the article.

- **[IndiQ Quantum Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/indiq-quantum-game-jam)** (Apr 18-21) - This jam was hosted in parallel to Ludum Dare 46 jam (LDJAM46), one of the largest online game jam in the world.. There is only one additional restriction: your games must run on a quantum computer or a quantum simulator. Despite having short marketing period, we received 5 submissions and 29 ratings for the jam. The entry ratings were open to the public. My wife and I teamed up and made "Keep Drogon Alive", a GoT themed, inverse space invaer, Ikaruga clone. You can play "Keep Drogon Alive" [here](https://kirais.itch.io/keep-drogon-alive).

## 2019

### November

- **Qiskit Advocate Online Demo** (Nov 7) - I shared my experience of organizing the first university Qiskit hackathon (Qiskit Hackathon @ Singapore) with fellow Qiskit advocates ([slides](https://slides.com/huangjunye/how-to-organize-a-qiskit-hackathon), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c46_LxO5mo4)).

### October

- **[Quantum Future Hackathon](https://indico.cern.ch/event/838035/)** (Oct 18-20)
  - I was invited by the organizer Oday Darwich participate in this hackathon at CERN. As a physicist (self-proclaimed), visiting CERN is a dream come true. I visited the CMS detector where the Higgs boson was discovered!
  - In this hackathon, I stepped out of my comfort zone (as you can tell from my blog posts, I am terrible at writing) and made a quantum story telling game: Woliverse. You can [play it here](https://huangjunye.github.io/Wolfiverse/).
  - After the hackathon, I followed Jack Hidary, Director of AI and Quantum at Alphabet X to visit EPFL, ETH Zurich and Google Zurich. I also visited IBM Research Zurich thanks to James Wootton's invitation.

- **[Qiskit Hackathon @ Singapore](https://www.quantumlah.org/about/highlight/2019-10-hackathon-quantum-coding)** (Oct 11-12)
  - This was the first ever university Qiskit hackathon in the world! I organized it together with Anurag Saha Roy and Evon Tan from Centre for Quantum Technologies.
  - It was the debut of my public speaking career! I gave an introduction to how to make games with Qiskit ([slides](https://slides.com/huangjunye/qiskit_game)) at Qiskit Hackathon @ Singapore.
  - I wrote [an article](https://huangjunye.github.io/from-qiskit-camp-to-qiskit-hackathon-at-singapore/) about the journey of organizing the hackathon.

## February

- **[Qiskit Camp 2019](https://medium.com/qiskit/recap-of-qiskit-camp-2019-4d95f07dd179)** (Feb 26 - Mar 1) - This was the beginning of my new career and birth of [QPong](https://github.com/HuangJunye/QPong).
