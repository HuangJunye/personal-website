<p>It is incredible how weak my perseverance is. Just one week after my resolution to read and write about Feynman Lecture, I procrastinated. This summary was due one week ago! I did continue to read the book, even faster than I planned; I am in chapter 6 already. However, I stopped thinking again. Reading faster or more is not the point of this exercise. What I want to change is the habit of thinking. I should stop reading and thinking about what I have read.</p>
<h2>Summary of Chapter 2</h2>
<p>This chapter is about the most fundamental ideas about physics.</p>
<p>First, Feynman discussed about the scientific method. The scientific method is about observation, reason and experiment. We see something about the world; we think about why these things happen and formulate an idea; we then do experiments to check out the ideas.</p>
<p>To check the rules of nature, to verify our understandings of the nature, there are three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Examine the rules directly under controlled environment</li>
<li>Examine the prediction or consequence of rules</li>
<li>Understand by rough approximation</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not so sure whether I understand what Feynman said, especially the third way. For a better understanding, I should analyse a concrete example. For example, gravitational law says that the gravitational force between objects scales linearly with their masses and inversely to the square of distance between them.</p>
<p>In the first way, we can imagine doing an experiment to measure the gravitational force between two heavy objects, such as two balls. The gravitational force can be measured by a torsion balance. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment">Cavendish experiment</a>) I could change the small ball to change its balance distance between the small and big ball. In a series of experiment, I can find out the force dependence of the masses of the balls as well as the distance. This would be a direct proof of the gravitational law. Of course, this experiment is no easy task. The force measured is extremely small. To prevent air current and temperature changes from interfering the measurement, Cavendish place the entire apparatus in a wooden box. And he observed the torsion balance far away using a telescope to prevent his own mass from interfering the result.</p>
<p>In the second way, we can examine the consequences or prediction of gravitational law. This brings the story of the discovery of Neptune. Astronomers predicted the existence of Â Neptune base on motions of Uranus that could not be accounted for by the actions of the other planets according to Newton's law of gravity. Neptune was later discovered pointing a telescope to the position calculated carefully using Newton's law of gravity.</p>
<p>In the third way, I don't know how to do it using the gravitational law example. But perhaps I can use dark matter or dark energy. I think right now we are understanding dark matter by approximation. We don't yet know what it is but we do know it exists, we know how much there is and we more or less know that it doesn't interact with other matter easily. From here and there we are gathering pieces of puzzles, until one day a breakthrough come about and we will understand it better.</p>
<p>Feynman then talked about unification of different phenomena. Heat, electricity, mechanics, magnetism, etc. were all considered different and unrelated. But later we understood, heat and mechanics are strongly related. Heat is just movement of atoms. Electricity and magnetism is two sides of the same coin: electromagnetism. Light is also related to electricity and magnetism; it is electromagnetic wave. This eventually brings the question: is there a theory of everything? I asked a related question to Frank Wilczek after his talk "There is plenty more room at the bottom" in Feynman 100 conference: "Is there a bottom?" Frank Wilczek answered that he doesn't know whether there will be a bottom or a theory of everything, but he think there will be a final theory. A final theory refers to a theory that not necessarily explains everything but most of the things in great enough details that we are satisfied with it. I personally don't believe in final theory. We learn from the history of modern physics that we can't settle for satisfaction. At the end of 19th century, the triumph of Maxwell's electromagnetism made people think that we understood everything. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys921">"In this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few holes."</a> Max Plank was so told by his supervisor Phillip von Jolly. What an irony to say that to the man who became the father of quantum mechanics later!</p>
<p>Feynman continues by describing our understanding of physics before 1920. More precisely, it should be physics before special and general relativity and quantum mechanics because both relativity theories were already discovered before 1920. At that time, we understood the universe is in a three-dimensional space of geometry. We knew there are particles such as atoms and electrons. We understood there are forces between objects, such as gravitational force and electromagnetic force. We understood that electricity and magnetism is strongly related and light is just a small portion of the entire spectrum of electromagnetic waves. We understood gas as a movement of particles and heat as the random internal motions. We understood there were different kinds of elements.</p>
<p>The description of quantum physics follows physics before 1920. The core ideas of quantum physics were introduced: uncertainty principle, particle-wave duality, probability nature. Feynman continues the story with his own field of expertise: quantum electrodynamics, aka QED and its prediction of anti-particles.</p>
<p>The last part was dedicated to the most recent particle experiments at time of the lecture around 1960. Strong and weak interaction was not well understood. Quarks were not known. Standard model of particle physics will need another decade to develop. It is for this part that I realise how fast physics has developed. We know so much more about all the particles and how they interact. We even found Higgs boson which gives mass to all other particles. We have a much better understand of how the universe was born. Although Feynman didn't mention much about condensed matter physics, but I could read elsewhere to know about the understanding of CMP in 1960s. Transistor was just invented. BCS theory was newly minted and we thought we understood superconductivity completely. There was no quantum Hall effect and the fractional and spin Hall effects. No high Tc superconductors. No topological materials. No cold atoms. No graphene and 2D materials. No perovskites.</p>
<h2>Questions for Chapter 2</h2>
<p>I didn't spend much thinking about any problems deeply this last two weeks. I should really change this habit. For now, I will write the questions I have for chapter 2.</p>
<ol>
<li>How do things get charged by rubbing? What determines which thing gets positive and which gets negative? Presumably this has to do with the ability of certain material to hold/attract electrons. But I would like to understand deeper. As least I should be able to explain why rubber rub against silk produces different charge from glass rub against silk.</li>
<li>Why is a AC current equivalent to electromagnetic wave? An AC current is driven by an alternating electric field. Is that equivalent to EM wave because the AC electric field will generate AC magnetic field?</li>
<li>What is the theoretical basis for uncertainty principle? Is it an axiom of quantum mechanics?</li>
<li>Anti-particle puzzle. Where is there more particle than anti-particles? Does it mean that there were more particles than anti-particles since the beginning of the universe? That means the universe was not born from nothing. Alternatively, maybe there is a way to get rid of anti-particles. But in that case, the conservation of particles will be violated.</li>
<li>What is the definition of anti-particle? I thought anti-particle is the same as particle except the charge is the opposite. If that is right, any particle without charges will be its own anti-particles. Perhaps this is only a necessary but not sufficient condition.</li>
<li>Can we always ask nature about " what is the use for it"? Is there always a reason for something to be?</li>
<li>What is the speed of light in media? Can we slow down light?</li>
<li>What are dark matter and dark energy? What is the distinction between the two? How do we know how much percentage they occupy in the universe?</li>
</ol>
