<p>This is the second post in the blog. I think I should probably give a brief introduction of myself.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingyuan">Qingyuan</a>, a small city in the Guangdong Province in South China. After a brief staying (really brief, only 3 months) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_University_of_Technology">South China University of Technology</a> (SCUT), I was awarded a scholarship to study in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyang_Technological_University">Nanyang Technological University</a> (NTU), Singapore.</p>
<p>In SCUT, my major was materials science and engineering (MSE). I can't remember what really made me choose this particular major, but I was convinced by myself that the reason was because my favourite chemistry teacher once said in the class: materials is the future! I didn't understand really what MSE is. But I thought it sounds like an interesting combination of chemistry and physics, which are both my favourite subjects (and both I did pretty well in school too). When I got the scholarship to study in NTU, I had one chance to change my major. At that time I really loved programming, so I wanted to change to computer science. But I still loved chemistry and physics, so I put "materials engineering (the acronym should be ME, but usually ME refers to mechanical engineering, so I will keep MSE as the acronym", "computer science (CS)", "computer engineering (CE)" in my application form. Because materials engineering is not a very popular major, I got into MSE again.</p>
<p>But soon after I stared my degree, I regretted it. Most courses in MSE need only memorisation, not  understanding and not reasoning. And I am particularly bad at memorisation. So I hated the courses and wanted to change my major to CS or CE. I had a lot of arguments with my mom and my uncle about switching my major. Both of them thought that MSE is a promising major, but too many people study in CS and CE, it will be difficult for me to find a job because I will not be able to distinguish myself among my peers. Even till now, I think they were completely wrong. Indeed there are more people studying in CS and CE than MSE, but there are also much more jobs available for CS, CE graduates than MSE! So at the end, MSE graduates are even more difficult to find jobs! But anyway, I didn't change my major, not because I didn't want to argue any more with my family, but because I loved one polymer course and thought maybe I could try MSE a bit longer than just one semester.</p>
<p>After first year of my degree, I was really into 3D printing for a while. I did some research in 3D printing and later interned at a local 3D printing startup called <a href="http://pirate3d.com/">Pirate3D</a>. For sometime I wanted to quit research and join the gang of hackers and makers to start my own company. But for most of my life, I want to become a scientist, but I have never imagined becoming a "physicist". I did pretty well in physics in school. I could score full marks in physics every now and then. And I had the best score, 296 out of 300, in science (combination of physics, chemistry and biology) in my city for the National Entrance Exam (Gaokao, in pinyin). But I knew I wasn't good enough to become a physicist. Only geniuses can become physicists. In high school, I was also courageous enough to compare myself with Newton. I tried to invent Calculus at the age of 17. I believed Newton did the same at that age but obviously he did it much later. The age 17 probably came from the story of Gauss demonstrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptadecagon">heptadecagon</a> (polygon with 17 edges) as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructible_polygon">constructible polygon</a> at the age of 19. (The 17 comes from the polygon rather than the age of Gauss at that time, :)) But I failed miserably. I didn't even know what calculus is! I just knew it's useful to calculate area under the curve.</p>
<p>So becoming a physicist never came into my mind, until I attended the <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/ias/upcomingevents/OCPA8/Pages/default.aspx">OCPA8 International Conference </a>(OCPA stands for Overseas Chinese Physicists Association) in June 2014. I was quite frustrated in MSE research at that time. I thought all MSE research were labor intensive activity, were just mixing stuff and cooking them. (I still think so) I couldn't much intellectual pleasure in doing MSE research. Sometimes I even felt MSE research was not scientific because it needs a lot of luck to do well. (true for many engineering disciplines) But I met many smart and cool physicists in the OCPA8 conference. Some of them are in charge of large high energy facilities, like Daya Bay neutrino experiment (<a href="http://english.ihep.cas.cn/pe/staff/200909/t20090902_35275.html">Wang Yifang</a>), future high energy electron-electron collider with over 100km ring (<a href="http://sourcedb.ihep.cas.cn/yw/pl/sf/201306/t20130621_3879817.html">Gao Jie</a>), future fusion reactor tokamak (<a href="http://dsxt.ustc.edu.cn/zj_ywjs.asp?zzid=3517">Ye Minyou</a>, <a href="http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/fsc/c40410.jsp">Wang Xiaogang</a>), etc. Some of them have heart moving stories in their road to becoming physicists (<a href="http://www.iop.cas.cn/rcjy/zgjgwry/?dir=zgjgwry&amp;t=detail&amp;id=409">Wu Lingan</a>, <a href="https://lecospa.ntu.edu.tw/person/w-y-pauchy-hwang/">W-Y. Pauchy Hwang</a>). I was particularly motivated by Prof Pauchy Hwang. He lost his right leg in a <a href="http://w3.tkgsh.tn.edu.tw/99s122/creative%20writing7.htm">car accident at the age of 10</a>. But despite the tragedy, he tried to study well and became a professor in National Taiwan University. However, about 10 years later, another tragedy happened to him. He had a stroke attack, and since then he has to stay in a wheelchair and he can't speak properly any more. But he still keep working on his physics research. I thought compare to his difficulties, my fear for physics is just like a piece of cake. If I love physics, I should at least give it a try.</p>
<p>So I did my final year project on molecular dynamic simulation of the photosynthetic reaction center of a bacteria. Although I didn't learn much about physics by doing this project per se, but I was exposed to some spin boson models in the weekly group meetings. Later I found a professor in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Quantum_Technologies">Centre for Quantum Technology</a> (CQT) in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore">National University of Singapore</a> (NUS), and he agreed on taking me as a PhD student. However, my application was rejected, probably due to competitive selection and my poor physics background. So at the end, I found a temporary research assistant position at <a href="http://erian.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx">Energy Research Institute @ NTU</a> (ERI@N), to do research on a recent hot topic: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskite_solar_cell">perovskite solar cells</a>.</p>
<p>At first I took this job as a temporary job just to feed myself, and meanwhile I studied more physics to prepare for next round of application. But after a while, I wanted to give up. Maybe physics is not for me and perovskite solar cell is a very promising topic that may bring me a lot of benefits. Indeed, I worked very hard and within a few months I got some interesting results to publish. The manuscript is almost ready for submission, and most of research work was done in October and November only! People in ERI@N start to appreciate my work and ability. Everything in my life is pointing to MSE again. But I don't feel secured. I don't feel happy. Somehow I feel this is not what I want. I did change my perspective on MSE research. Sometimes it can be fun and innovative. But most of the time is still cooking, and no reasoning, at least in ERI@N. I want more mental challenges and intellectual pleasures. I want to feel smart during and after PhD.</p>
<p>About one month ago, I gave myself the last chance to try physics. I attended the <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/ias/upcomingevents/ICTP/Pages/default.aspx">School on Quantum Information Processing</a> co-organised by the <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/ias/Pages/default.aspx">Institute of Advanced Studies in NTU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Centre_for_Theoretical_Physics">International Centre for Theoretical Physics</a>. I got the same feeling I had in the OCPA8 conference. I felt very excited and anxious. I felt that everybody in the room is smarter than me, more capable than me, and I want to be as smart as they are. I felt everything they do is cool and interesting and I also want to work on the same thing. After the first week, I decided to apply for CQT again. I approached a professor in CQT, Prof Kwek, who I have also contacted one year ago. He knows me quite well and try to persuade me that ERI@N is a good place to be and energy is a good field to work on because Singapore government just announced a huge research plan in which hundreds of millions of dollars will go into sustainability research in the next 5 years. And if I want to switch to physics, computational materials might be easier for me, rather than quantum information. I think his advices are very reasonable, but I still want to go to CQT. So he suggest me to publish a paper before I apply again to demonstrate my knowledge and ability to do research in physics. Publish a paper in three months! from scratch! from a non-physics major student! It's like the challenge for the famous Mandopop singer Jay Chou to write 10 hit songs in a week to put in his first album. He did it and he became a superstar. But, can I do the same? Let's witness this. I'll keep posting my progress in this blog.</p>
<p>Prof Kwek suggested me to study in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_walk">quantum random walk</a>. I found it also fit my journey to become a physicist, and hence it become the title for this post.</p>
