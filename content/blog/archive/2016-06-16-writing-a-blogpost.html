<p>Every time I want to write a blogpost, I will have tremendous pressure. I don't want to write something that make others think I am stupid. I want to write something that is logical and thoughtful like <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/">Wait But Why</a>. But then, with all these things in my head, I will never really write a post. So, I decided, from now on, I will just write whatever that is in my head. No one will give a shit to what I write. In fact, no one reads my blog at all.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-525" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/blog-views.jpg" alt="blog-views" width="740" height="371" /></p>
<p>So fuck it. This blog should be my little playground, my own kingdom. Just treat it as a notebook, a diary. I just want to write as freely as I felt in my first blog on Baidu when I was in secondary school and high school.</p>
