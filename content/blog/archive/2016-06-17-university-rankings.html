<p>NTU loves rankings. If you go to its official website, you can see most of its news highlights are about rankings:</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=a69ccf5b-a0ee-497f-9e17-5d107383b133">NTU is the 3rd in Asia and 1st in research citations</a>"</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=1019cb80-115a-4978-8c59-2e741052f145">Top in Singapore, 32nd globally. 5th in Chemistry, 27th in Physical Sciences in Nature Index 2016</a>"</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=bedc4e0d-8bb1-4874-b3fb-09d5d3cedbaa">No.2 among the world's young universities. NTU.</a>"</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=399b3b92-74a5-45d2-961c-25973663170f">Singapore's no. 1 MBA programme. NTU jumps 11 places to 29th globally.</a>"</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=52a28739-5ba9-472b-b528-21d56d450975">NTU is ranked No.1 for the 2nd consecutive year in QS young universities world ranking</a>"</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=7d250436-388e-4db9-b8ac-2327f2d06fe0">NTU jumps 114 places in 4 years</a>"</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=30089ded-0349-42a3-b180-7176bb19f96d">NTU charges ahead to no.13 globally</a>"</p>
<p>It's a bit too much, isn't it? When I started my undergraduate study in 2011, NTU was only ranked <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/the-7-fastest-rising-young-universities-in-the-world/2019337.article">169th</a> in Times Higher Education ranking. Now, it's <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/nanyang-technological-university?ranking-dataset=133819">55th</a>. In QS ranking, which in general ranks NTU much higher than THE ranking, NTU now is <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/nanyang-technological-university-singapore-ntu#wur">13th</a> in the world, just one place behind its old brother NUS.</p>
<p>The subject ranking is even more exaggerating, especially for materials science. QS ranks NTU at <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2016/materials-sciences#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=">6th</a>, and US News ranks NTU at <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/materials-science">2nd</a>, surpassing all the world class universities, like Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Cambridge, only behind MIT.</p>
<p>As a alumnus of School of Materials Science and Engineering at NTU, I am of course more than thrilled to know that our school (actually the subject ranking ranks all the materials science related papers published across all the schools in NTU, rather than only MSE) is on par with the world's best. But I clearly know that these rankings can't give the whole picture. There is no doubt that NTU publishes high impact papers, and in a huge amount, which is basically what the methodologies of these rankings are based on. But most of NTU research are just good, not excellent. We have a lot of Advanced Materials, JACS, EES, ACS nano, nanoscale papers, but seldom publish Nature/Science papers. There is not much scientific breakthroughs here. For this fact, I don't think we are on par with Stanford, UC Berkeley and Cambridge.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite the inevitable flaws in any rankings, these rankings by different entities clearly show that NTU is on the rise. Like our president Bertil Anderson said in the email in response to the QS ranking last year where NTU was ranked at 13th:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know some of us may scoff at rankings, but I will argue that while it may be an imperfect and blunt measurement of the quality of universities, it is useful to young universities like NTU. It allows up-and-coming universities like us to benchmark with the best in the world and visualise our progress.</p>
<p>In the old days before rankings, legacy and reputation perceptions mattered most. Isn’t that even more imperfect, to have perceptions passed down through the centuries about which universities are doing good work?</p>
<p>It would be difficult for young universities to compete against the established ones without a more objective system for measuring progress. With the common yardsticks today, young universities can show how they are raising the ante in competition with the older, established universities.</p></blockquote>
<p>With these rankings, NTU can confidently advertise itself, attract better students, better faculty, and in turn push its research level to a new height. At the very least, next time someone ask me about where I studied, I can proudly say that I studied in one of the world's best universities and one of the best schools. :)</p>
