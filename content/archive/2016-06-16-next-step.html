<p>I mentioned in a earlier <a href="https://huangjunye.wordpress.com/2016/05/21/phd-application/">post</a> that I will go to NUS to do my PhD. The PhD application is still processing, but I will start working in Prof  Özyilmaz's lab from 15 Aug. I will be working on the study of spin transport properties of phosphorene, monolayer of black phosphorous. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorene">Phosphorene</a> was first discovered in 2013 by a group of physicists in China. The lead scientist is called <a href="http://www.physics.fudan.edu.cn/english/index.php/using-joomla/extensions/components/content-component/article-categories/94-yuanbo-zhang-webpage">Zhang Yuanbo</a>, who was among the first researcher to work on graphene in 2004 while he was doing PhD in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Kim">Philip Kim</a>'s group. Zhang Yuanbo became a professor in Fudan University in Shanghai in 2009. He is one of the most renown young scientists in 2D materials. I hope I will be as good as he is.</p>
<p>Prof Özyilmaz's group was also among the first to report about phosphorene and its electric field effect. <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/104/10/10.1063/1.4868132">That paper</a> has been already cited over 300 times, only after 2 years of its publication. Phosphorene is now the hottest 2D material, due to its low band gap (tunable from 0.3 to 2 eV) and high mobility (up to 1000 cm<sup>2</sup>⋅V<sup>−1</sup>⋅s<sup>−1</sup>). It can be used in energy storage, photovoltaics, thermoelectrics and of course nanoelectronics. The main research activity in Prof Özyilmaz's group is graphene spintronics. Given the rise of phosphorene, it is natural to expand the graphene spintronics activity to phosphorene spintronics. In fact, Prof Özyilmaz told me they already obtained great results and submitted the manuscript to a Nature series journal (Nature Physics or Nature Nanotechnology) So it is already proven that phosphorene is a proven great material for spintronics, and my PhD is guarantee to be a success as long as I make my full efforts into it. I'll be thrilled to be able to work on cutting-edge research and publish in Nature or Science journals. It seems I am so close to tip of ivory tower of research!</p>
<p>Ideally, if everything works well, I will be able to publish a few great papers by the end of my PhD. And I will be good to go to TOP10 universities to do postdoc. It is definitely too early to think about it. But me being me, I already thought of a potential supervisor for my postdoc: <a href="http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/jarillo-herrero_pablo.html">Pablo Jarillo-Herrero</a> at MIT. I am sure you will be amazed by his list of publications. Out of only 60 papers he published, 25 (21 in the last 6 years) papers are on Nature/Science (excluding Nature Communications)! His main research focus is quantum transport study in 2D materials, which is closely related to what I will do. In fact, Prof Özyilmaz has collaboration with him. They both did postdoc in Philip Kim's group. I can't believe MIT is so close to me. In the summer of my freshmen year, I went to visit MIT (just for tourism). I spent two days just wondering around MIT campus. Have you ever had an experience of feeling like in the heaven, feeling satisfied just by the fact that you are there? It's like a Muslim finally reach Mecca. That's how I felt. At that time, I was so convinced that I would do my PhD in MIT. I found a corner near the famous dome of MIT and wrote "I'll be back" using a rock. I'll be so satisfied if I can finally do research to MIT, even just for one or two years as postdoc.</p>
<p>I really can't wait to start working in NUS.</p>
