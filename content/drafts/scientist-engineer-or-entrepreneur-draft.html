<p>Scientist, engineer, or entrepreneur?</p>
<p>This question has struck me many times in my life.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I found my notebook in primary school when I cleared my stuff of my room in my hometown. In the notebook, it was written "I want to become a scientist who devote himself to contributing to humanity." It was a surprise and joy to found this sentence, although it was merely a dream from a 10-year-old boy who didn't have a single idea what it took to become a scientist.</p>
<p>In high school, I was amazed by Google's products (especially Google Earth) and its mission statement: "to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful". At that time Microsoft was still the biggest IT company, but Google was growing very rapidly and everyone expects it to beat Microsoft to become the Kind of IT. Very naturally, my dream was to build a company which will beat Google and become the King of IT. It was merely a joke: I said it just because it sounded cool to do so.</p>
<p>I stated to think about this question more seriously in university.</p>
<p>I chose Materials Engineering as my major in China because my high school chemistry teacher once said: materials is the future of 21st century. That wasn't the only reason though. I loved both physics and chemistry. However, I never thought that I could become a physicist or a chemist; they are too tough for me. And if I can't become a scientist (do PhD), the outcome could be devastating  if I chose physics or chemistry major: immediate unemployment after graduation. So I thought materials engineering might be a good choice: I have the possibility of becoming a scientist, and the possibility of working in a company after undergraduate.</p>
<p>Before I got to know more about materials engineering program in my Chinese university, I was chosen to study in Nanyang Technological University in Singapore under a scholarship. I had one more chance to change my major. During the bridging course (6-month preparatory course before entering NTU), I was crazy about programming. For a while, I couldn't sleep very well. My mind was full of codes and algorithms. I could wake up in the midnight with a new idea from my subconscious in the dream and start coding. Eventually, I put Computer Science and Computer Engineering under Materials Engineering as my major choices. Of course, because materials engineering was not a very popular major, I was enrolled in the major instead of computer.</p>
<p>So again, I studied materials engineering. I started to do research as early as my second year. At that time I was fascinated by additive manufacturing, or more commonly known, 3D printing. I started my first research attachment in Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech). Later in my third year's internship, I went to a local 3D printer manufacturing startup called Pirate3D. Compared to Pirate3D (same field but different style) and the research I have done later (same style but different field), my research project in SIMTech was primitive and of low productivity, despite that I had a great Iranian mentor who always gave me a lot of encouragement and inspirations. While I was an exchange student in Tokyo Institute of Technology, I did some research on nanogap electrodes.</p>
