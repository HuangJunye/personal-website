<p>Recently, I have read a biography and a few excellent <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html">blogposts</a> on wait but why about Elon Musk. For those who don't know about Elon Musk, he is the most crazy entrepreneur in the world. He was a co-founder of a few Internet companies, including PayPal. He is currently running at the same time two of the most incredible startups in the world: SpaceX and Tesla Motor.</p>
<p>SpaceX is awesome. It was founded by Elon at 2002, aiming to colonise Mars to make us, homo sapiens sapiens, a multi-planetary species. Through many years of struggles, SpaceX has designed its rocket engines and many other parts from ground up, making its rockets the cheapest yet one of the most powerful ones in history. Its rockets can be launched and return to the designate areas with accuracy of a few meters like science fiction. It has plans to send unmanned spacecrafts to Mars at 2018 and eventually send people to Mars as early as 2025.</p>
<p>To be fair, compare to SpaceX, Tesla Motor is a bit less exciting, but that doesn't prevent Tesla to revolutionise our life. Tesla is not the first company to produce electric vehicles. In fact, electric cars exist as long as internal combustion engine cars. The core innovation of Tesla's cars is the use of lithium ion batteries. With high energy density Li ion batteries and great batteries management software, Tesla's Model S outperform any luxury cars on the market with 4.2s acceleration from 0 to 60 mph while keeping a long driving range of 300 miles. Next year, Tesla is going to release the more affordable Model 3 with acceleration from 0 to 60 mph under 6s and 215 miles range at around 35,000 USD. Right now, there's less than 200,000 Tesla cars (Model S + Model X) on the road. But as of May 2016, the reservation of Model 3 already reached 373,000 and Tesla has plans to produce over a million Model 3. Though still a small number compare to worldwide annual production of  close to 100 millions cars, together with the competition Tesla has attracted (Nissan Leaf, BMW i3, etc), Model 3 is going to lead a electric vehicle revolution in the coming years.</p>
<p>One of the most striking characteristic of Elon Musk, as pointed out by Tim Urban on his Wait But Why posts, is his ability to think on first principle. He reasoned that because the raw materials cost of a rocket is merely 2% of its currently cost, there must be ways to cut down the cost of a rocket significantly through innovation. He deeply believes in this conclusion and use his leadership power to drive his employees to innovate. The result, SpaceX created the most efficient rocket engine in history, it cut down costs of numerous components by using consumer grade electronics component which were proven to be reliable enough for space travel, and most important of all, SpaceX is inventing a way to cut down rocket launch cost by reusing its rockets. For Tesla, as I said, it's not the first electric car in the world. Its key innovation is in the batteries. It replaced traditional lead acid or nickel hydrogen battery with higher energy density Li ion batteries.</p>
